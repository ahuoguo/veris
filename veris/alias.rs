//! ## Algorithm
//! Preprocess weights a₀,…,a_{n−1} (total m) into two length-n tables, `prob` and
//! `alias`, so that the n equal-probability "bins" (one per index) each hold total
//! mass m, split between two labels:  bin i holds prob[i] units of label i and
//! (m − prob[i]) units of label alias[i].  Multiplying weights by n, the tables are
//! built so that each label k's total units across all bins is n·aₖ
//!
//! Sampling is two uniform draws and a comparison:
//!
//!   i ← Uniform{0,…,n−1}                        // pick a bin
//!   r ← Uniform{0,…,m−1}                        // pick within the bin
//!   return  if r < prob[i] { i } else { alias[i] }
//!
//! Then  P(k) = (1/n)·Σ_i ( [i=k]·prob[i] + [alias[i]=k]·(m−prob[i]) ) / m
//!            = (1/(n·m))·(total units of k across all bins).
//! For this to equal aₖ/m we need (total units of k) = n·aₖ — which is exactly the
//! `valid_alias` condition `label_units(t, n, k) == n·weights(k)`
//!
//! ## Expectation-Preservation Rule
//!            ε ≥ Σ_{i<n} (aᵢ/m)·ℰ(i)
//!   ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!   [{ ↯(ε) }] sample_alias(tab) [{ i. ↯(ℰ(i)) }]
//!
//! The two uniform draws nest.  The OUTER bin draw is funded with `inner_eps(i)` = bin_credit(i)/m
//! =  1/m · (prob[i]·ℰ(i) + (m−prob[i])·ℰ(alias[i])) — which is the average the INNER threshold draw
//! needs to then yield ↯(ℰ(result)):  average_{r<m} ℰ(r<prob[i] ? i : alias[i]) = inner_eps(i)
//! (`lemma_inner_average`, a step sum split at prob[i] via `lemma_ialloc_stepsum`).
//!
//! It then remains to fund the outer draw from ε, i.e. to show its average is the target:
//!   average_{i<n} inner_eps(i)  =  Σ_{k<n} (aₖ/m)·ℰ(k)           (`lemma_average_outer`)
//! Clearing the /m and /n, this is  Σ_i bin_credit(i) = n·Σ_k aₖ·ℰ(k)  (`lemma_bin_sum_eq`)
//!
//! `bin_contrib(i,k)`: the count of label-k units sitting in bin i: prob[i] of them when k = i 
//! (m−prob[i]) when k = alias[i], 0 otherwise.
//!
//!   Σ_i bin_credit(i)  =  Σ_i Σ_k ℰ(k)·bin_contrib(i,k)    -- per bin (≤2 labels): lemma_bin_contrib_sum_sel
//!                      =  Σ_k ℰ(k)·Σ_i bin_contrib(i,k)    -- lemma_fubini
//!                      =  Σ_k ℰ(k)·label_units(k)          -- label_units(k) := Σ_i bin_contrib(i,k)
//!                      =  Σ_k ℰ(k)·(n·aₖ) = n·Σ_k aₖ·ℰ(k)   -- lemma_label_credit_sum_validity

//! ## Preprocessing: `build_alias`
//! Scale weights by n: scaled_weights[i] = n·aᵢ. A bin is _small_ if scaled_weights[i] < m, 
//! _large_ if ≥ m, and active until finalized. Each step pops a small bin s
//! and a large bin l, then finalizes s: prob[s] ← scaled_weights[s], alias[s] ← l (s keeps
//! its own units and borrows the (m − scaled_weights[s]) shortfall from l), and re-pushes 
//! l by its new count.
//!
//! Three major invariants:
//!  - Mass:  placed(k) + scaled_weights[k] = n·aₖ for every label k, where placed(k) sums the
//!    finalized bins' contributions.  Each finalize moves the donated units scaled→placed
//!    (`lemma_placed_update`); holds at entry as placed = 0 (`lemma_placed_zero`).
//!  - Balance:  Σ_{active} scaled_weights = (#active)·m.  Forces a large partner to exist when
//!    small is nonempty — else the active sum would be < (#active)·m (`lemma_sum_active_le`).
//!  - Worklists hold exactly the active small / large bins, duplicate-free
//!    (`lemma_reestablish_worklists`).
