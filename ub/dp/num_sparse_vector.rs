// NumSparseVector (LightDP, Figure 11 / §6.1).
//
// Numeric variant of SparseVector. Three independent noise sources:
//   η₁ : num(1)                         — threshold noise, scale 3/ε
//   η₂ : num(2 if q[i]+η₂ ≥ T else 0)  — comparison noise, scale 6N/ε
//   η₃ : num(−^q[i])                    — release noise, scale 3N/ε
//
// η₂ decides the branch exactly as in SparseVector. In the TRUE branch we
// sample a *fresh* η₃ whose distance cancels ^q[i], so the released value
// q[i]+η₃ has distance 0 (LightDP `num(0)`, safe to release).
//
// No adjacency assumption needed. Per-iter η₃ cost ≤ 1·ε/(3N), summing
// to ≤ N·(ε/(3N)) = ε/3 over N TRUE branches.
//
// Budget accounting (total ε):
//   η₁:  1 / (3/ε)         = ε/3
//   η₂:  per TRUE 2 / (6N/ε) = ε/(3N); N TRUEs       ⇒ ε/3
//   η₃:  per TRUE |^q[i]| / (3N/ε) ≤ ε/(3N); N TRUEs ⇒ ε/3
